# reverseproxy
Reverse proxy implementation

Simple reverse proxy for development purposes. It will sit between a http client and a target. 
We intend to implement an http and an AJP proxy.

Code is going to be refactored containing two proxies, one http proxy based on Apache HttpComponents and 
the other on an AJP client.
